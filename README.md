Developing a Virtual Blended Shadow Puppet World in the Unreal Engine

# Meta-Project Proposal: Virtual World Development for Balanced Blended Space (BBS)

## Overview
This meta-project is part of the larger **Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP)** initiative and is itself part of the **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)** framework. The project aims to design and develop a robust virtual world within the Unreal that integrates physical and virtual elements, ensuring holistic representation of both spaces. By leveraging cutting-edge tools like Unreal Engine, georeferencing, and AI-driven dynamics, this effort will serve as a platform for cultural storytelling, shadow puppetry integration with physical components of the Blended Shadow Puppet project, and innovative research into balanced physical-virtual interactions.  This project further expands on the development of a Blended Reality Performance System by creating strong isomorphic relationships between physical and virtual space.  

The development of this virtual environment will start with the creation of a virtual Shadow Puppet set that responds to light interactions similarly to phsyical shadow puppetry.  This investigation will determine the programming approach to shadow mechanics.  Once this more local environment has been demonstrated, then we can extend and scale the world to support the larger activities.

## Efforts
Rodrigo Vega Internship Spring 2025.  - Development of a prototype environment in Unreal  [Link to proposal](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Unreal-BSP/edit/main/Proposals/Vega-R-Internship%20Proposal.md)

## Objectives
1. **Prototype a Virtual Simulation of the Shadow Puppet Theatre stage and performance spaces**
   - Prototype a virtual space modeled on a planar coordinate system.
   - Develop a virtual model of the physical performance space of the BSP Theatre project.
   - Investigate possibilities for shadow casting in hopes of simulating equivalent usage in a physical performance of shadow puppet theatre.
     
2. **Develop a Comprehensive Virtual Environment**:
   - Extend testing to encompass larger structures and geographic locations.
   - Create a virtual space modeled on spherical coordinate systems for global scalability.
   - Integrate dynamic physics, light-shadow mechanics, and responsive environments.

3. **Support Cross-Disciplinary Research**:
   - Provide an experimental platform for projects across engineering, art, narrative design, and computational science.
   - Encourage research into geospatial systems, physics simulations, and AI applications in blended realities.

4. **Establish a Holistic Framework for Integration**:
   - Align virtual world components with BBS principles, ensuring symmetry between physical and virtual interactions.
   - Create interoperable systems that adapt to diverse modalities such as performance art, games, and simulations.

5. **Expand the BSP Canon**:
   - Populate the virtual world with cultural and historical narratives, tying them to traditional shadow puppetry themes.
   - Enable a cohesive fictional universe with interconnected geographies, characters, and events.
