### **Skill Assessments:**  
- JavaScript, C#, Unreal Engine 5, Blueprint Scripting  
- 2D/3D Design, Video Editing  
- Game Design, Asset Creation  
- Character Modeling and Rigging  

### **Project Overview:**  
The aim of this internship is to develop and integrate character and environmental assets for the Blended Shadow Puppet (BSP) game environment, now transitioning from Unity to **Unreal Engine 5**. Hugo Sanchez will work alongside Rodrigo Vega, who is developing a **flat-surface virtual environment** for the **Blended Reality Performance System (BRPS)**. The focus of Hugo’s work will be the creation of **new characters, props, and other assets**, ensuring compatibility with the lighting and physics-based shadow interactions being researched and implemented in Unreal Engine.

At this stage, **the Unreal Engine environment is not expected to be fully functional**. The main goal is to **simulate how light and occlusion create shadows for traditional shadow puppetry**, which will serve as the foundation for further development. Hugo’s initial task will be to **move virtual shadow puppets into this experimental space** and develop a workflow for rendering accurate shadow behaviors.

This project continues the **world-building initiative** within the BSP project, integrating **traditional shadow puppetry aesthetics** with modern virtual storytelling tools. The assets created will contribute to the **WorldAnvil** environment, housing lore and canonical material for BSP, and will also be maintained in a GitHub repository for collaborative development.

### **Project Goals:**  
1. **Character and Asset Creation:** Develop and refine 2D and 3D character models, props, and environmental assets optimized for Unreal Engine.  
2. **Shadow Simulation:** Implement assets within an environment that allows for testing **light, occlusion, and shadow-casting** mechanics relevant to traditional shadow puppetry.  
3. **Adaptation to Unreal Engine 5:** Convert previous work done in Unity to Unreal Engine 5-compatible formats and workflows.  
4. **World Building Contribution:** Integrate character designs and backstory elements into **WorldAnvil**, ensuring narrative consistency with BSP lore.  
5. **Collaboration with Rodrigo Vega:** Align assets with the lighting and projection-based shadow systems being developed for the flat-surface environment.  
6. **Surface Texture Research:** Determine the most effective method for representing puppet shadows—whether using **.png files with alpha transparency** or physically modeled shadow puppet shapes. This decision will emerge from research conducted during this project.  
7. **Implementation & Optimization:** Ensure assets are structured for real-time rendering, applying **Lumen-based lighting, translucent materials, and shadow physics** to maximize visual fidelity in Unreal Engine.

### **Scope of Work:**

#### **Phase 1: Research & Unreal Engine Adaptation (20-25 hours)**  
- Study Unreal Engine 5’s **character rigging, animation, and physics-based shadow interactions**.  
- Analyze existing BSP assets to determine necessary **reformatting or reworking** for Unreal Engine.  
- Research **translucent material handling, light projection systems, and occlusion physics** in Unreal.  
- Investigate the feasibility of **.png alpha-based shadows versus fully 3D-modeled puppets**.  

#### **Phase 2: Character & Asset Design (25-30 hours)**  
- Create concept art and 3D models for **a new character** inspired by traditional and modern puppet aesthetics.  
- Develop character backstory, cultural integration notes, and integration plans within **WorldAnvil**.  
- Collaborate with Rodrigo Vega to **ensure character design aligns with the flat-surface virtual environment**.  
- Establish **technical parameters** (polygon count, LODs, materials) for seamless integration into Unreal Engine.  

#### **Phase 3: Asset Creation & Rigging (35-40 hours)**  
- Develop **high-fidelity 3D models** and **optimized texture maps** (normal, roughness, emissive).  
- Implement **rigging and skeletal structures** for animation-ready models.  
- Create custom animations aligned with **shadow puppet storytelling methods**.  
- Test character interactions with Unreal’s **light-shadow system**, refining for accurate projections.  

#### **Phase 4: Unreal Engine Integration & Testing (25-30 hours)**  
- Import assets into **Unreal Engine 5** and configure Blueprint-based interactions.  
- Optimize **material translucency and occlusion settings** for realistic shadow effects.  
- Perform iterative **testing** to ensure character functionality within the BSP game environment.  
- Document integration steps and update GitHub with progress reports.  

#### **Phase 5: Evaluation & Documentation (15-20 hours)**  
- Write a **reflective analysis** detailing how traditional puppetry was adapted for Unreal Engine.  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of asset integration and recommend improvements for future iterations.  
- Present results to the BSP team and prepare assets for **final submission to GitHub**.

### **Deliverables:**  
1. **Character Assets:** Fully rigged 3D model with animations and textures.  
2. **World Building Contribution:** A detailed character backstory added to **WorldAnvil**.  
3. **Cultural Analysis Report:** A written discussion on **traditional vs. modern adaptation** of puppet aesthetics.  
4. **Unreal Engine Integration:** Optimized assets and functionality within **Rodrigo Vega’s virtual environment**.  
5. **Documentation & Presentation:** A comprehensive report on the development process.

### **Learning Outcomes:**  
- **Advanced Unreal Engine 5 Skills:** Gain expertise in **3D asset creation, rigging, and Blueprint scripting**.  
- **Game Development Workflow:** Learn best practices for asset integration, optimization, and version control.  
- **Collaboration & Adaptation:** Experience working alongside another developer (Rodrigo Vega) to integrate assets into a shared virtual space.  
- **Cultural Sensitivity in Digital Art:** Deepen understanding of **Javanese and global shadow puppetry traditions**.

### **Adjusted Time Commitment:**  
Since Hugo has already completed some work, we will **subtract** the time already spent from the original 120-hour estimate. The revised estimate for this semester is approximately **100 hours**, focusing on the transition to Unreal Engine, character development, and integration. 

#### **Updated Hour Distribution:**  
- **Research & Unreal Engine Adaptation:** 20-25 hours  
- **Character & Asset Design:** 25-30 hours  
- **Asset Creation & Rigging:** 35-40 hours  
- **Unreal Engine Integration & Testing:** 25-30 hours  
- **Evaluation & Documentation:** 15-20 hours

### **Next Steps:**  
1. **Hugo Sanchez to review and confirm feasibility of the revised scope.**  
2. **Align with Rodrigo Vega’s development timeline for Unreal Engine integration.**  
3. **Set up Unreal Engine 5 project repository within CHI GitHub organization.**  
4. **Begin research phase and initial design drafts.**
