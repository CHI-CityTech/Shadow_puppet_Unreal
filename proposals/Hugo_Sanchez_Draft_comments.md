Discussion regarding Asset collection: last semester it was in Unity, this semester we are investigating Unreal.  [Here is a link to asset import for Unreal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/importing-assets-directly-into-unreal-engine).

Wants to develop and import a complete character from the Shadow Puppet World into Unreal.  this will be scaffolded in the same way as the original proposal which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D0gLshPyi1vUYD-bbPJFFzqs0kgrPUw-iIuQubf28-I/edit?usp=sharing).

Hugo will send to me his google link sheet that catalogs the hours he already contributed, and we will then revise the document to meet expectations for remaining time.  The focus will remain the same; the gaming platform will change.  Hugo will work with Rodrigo Vega who will be doing the coding part.  [Here is Rodrigo's Proposal](https://github.com/CHI-CityTech/Unreal-BSP/blob/main/Proposals/Vega-R-Internship%20Proposal.md).

David will update the proposal to include the new language, and then Hugo will verify that this makes sense.  

Hugo will also provide David with his availability:  please provide this as a generic week: this means that certainly certain weeks will be differetn, but for teh most part when are you available for meetings and project activity?
